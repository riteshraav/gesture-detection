# Pose Embedding Caching & Comparison in Flutter


## ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Feature                    | `pgvector (Supabase)`          | `ObjectBox (Flutter)`           | 
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | 
| **Local or Remote**        | 🟡 Remote / Self-hosted        | ✅ Fully local                   |
| **Flutter Native**         | ✅ Via Supabase client          | ✅ Dart-native                   | 
| **Offline Capable**        | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                           |
| **Ease of Setup**          | 🟡 Requires Docker/Supabase    | ✅ Easy with Dart plugin         | 
| **Similarity Search**      | ✅ Built-in (cosine, L2, inner) | 🟡 Manual (custom Dart logic)   | 
| **Query Language**         | ✅ SQL-based                    | ✅ Dart API                      |
| **Embedding Size Support** | ✅ Up to 1536+                  | 🟡 Good for 128–512             |
| **Best Use Case**          | ✅ Central training, analytics  | ✅ Personal, on-device inference |

## 🔧 Recommendations

### ✅ Use **ObjectBox** if:

* You want full **offline support**
* You plan to analyze embeddings **per user**
* You want **fast**, native Dart experience

### ✅ Use **pgvector** (with Supabase or Postgres) if:

* You want to **aggregate embeddings** across users
* You want server-side **vector queries**
* You’re okay with a **backend dependency**

### ✅ Use a **Hybrid Setup**:

* Cache locally in `ObjectBox`
* Sync to `pgvector` in Supabase for central training & analysis

## 🧮 Vector Similarity Example (Dart)

```dart
double cosineSimilarity(List<double> a, List<double> b) {
  double dot = 0, magA = 0, magB = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    dot += a[i] * b[i];
    magA += a[i] * a[i];
    magB += b[i] * b[i];
  }
  return dot / (sqrt(magA) * sqrt(magB));
}
```
